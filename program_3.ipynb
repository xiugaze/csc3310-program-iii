    "# Program 3: Quick Select\n",
    "### Wesley Jochman, Cody Morrow, Caleb Andreano\n",

    "The selection problem takes a sequence of $n \\geq 2$ numbers and and integer $k$, $1 \\leq k \\leq n$ and returns the $k^{th}$ smallest element in the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is solved using a divide and conquer approach. For each iteration, a pivot value is chosen randomly from the target array. The array is then partitioned into three arrays based on the pivot:\n",
    "- The `left` array will contain all values strictly less than the pivot\n",
    "- The `same` array will contain all values equal to the pivot\n",
    "- The `right` array will contain all values strictly greater than the pivot. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, if $k$ is less than the length of the `left` array, we know that the $k^{th}$ smallest element must be in this array. In this case, we recurse using only the `left` array. \n",
    "\n",
    "If $k$ is equal to the length of the `left` array plus one, we know that the $k^{th}$ element is *not* in the left array. Since the `right` array contains every element that is strictly greater than the pivot, we now know that the $k^{th}$ smalles element is equal to the pivot. Therefore, we've found the target, so return the pivot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, we know that the $k^{th}$ smalles element *must* be in the right array. We recurse on the right array, decementing $k$ by the length of the left arrayn as well as decementing $k$ by the number of values found that are identical to the pivots, or the length of the `same` array. \n",
